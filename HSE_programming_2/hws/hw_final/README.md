The construction process was as follows.

1. Using w2v National Russian Corpora model created a list of problems for the game in Jupyter notebook.
 (This part of the programm needs a model file, which is too big to include here. You can download it:http://rusvectores.org/static/models/rusvectores4/RNC/ruscorpora_upos_skipgram_300_5_2018.vec.gz)

2. Manually checked the puzzles to delete improperly formed ones.

3. Ran a python game version

4. Made the site (link)
